# to-the-beat
A fighting game with tempo-based movement.
---

This project is currently in development. There is not a working build just
yet, as the main controls have not been implemented.

---
## Features
* Input tied to the music's tempo where movement takes place on a 
one-dimensional grid. Think of Crypt of the Necrodancer, but as a fighting game.
* Character animation tied to the music's tempo, where the characters bob to the beat
