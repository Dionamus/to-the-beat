# to-the-beat
A fighting game with tempo-based movement.
---

This project is currently in development. There is not a working build just
yet, as the main controls have not been implemented.

## Features
* Input is tied to the music's tempo, where movement takes place on a
one-dimensional grid. Think of Crypt of the Necrodancer, but as a fighting game.
* Character animations are tied to the music's tempo, where the characters bob
to the beat.
* X characters to choose from. Where X is how many characters I want to add.
(There is only one right now.)
