# to-the-beat

A fighting game with tempo-based input.

---

This project has been abandoned. I don't want to deal with demands for an ever growing roster amd burn myself out more than I already am.

## Features

* Input is tied to the music's tempo, where movement takes place on a
one-dimensional grid. Think of Crypt of the Necrodancer, but as a fighting game.
* Character animations are tied to the music's tempo, where the characters bob
to the beat.
* X characters to choose from. Where X is how many characters I want to add.
(There is only one right now.)
